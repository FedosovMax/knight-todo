Knight to do project it's an implementation of the idea of gamification to the to-do list. 
User is able to create tasks for himself and choose the level of difficulty and scarity and then in accordence of those values he'll get an experience.
Also in the future a scenario is planned. 

We have a micro-service architecture and for now there are 3 micro-services: to-do, experience, user. Each of them is in charge of his part of
functionality.
